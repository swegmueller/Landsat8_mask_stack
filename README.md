# Landsat8_mask_stack

This notebook contains a simple tool I built to mask and stack Landsat 8 images. Masking is done using the QA Pixels file, which is generated using the CFMask algorithm. The only block you have to edit is the one which sets the location of the files. There is a block which shows you the mask before you write the files, allowing you to change it if needed.
